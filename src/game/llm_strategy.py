"""
LLM-powered strategy and reasoning for the "Who Is Spy" game.

This module implements the AI agent intelligence system that enables players to:
- Dynamically infer their own identity through conversation analysis
- Generate strategic speech based on confidence levels
- Form suspicions about other players with confidence scores
- Make voting decisions based on accumulated evidence

Key Features:
- Dynamic Identity Inference: Real-time role analysis through speech patterns
- Probabilistic Belief System: Self-belief and suspicions with confidence scores
- Strategic Speech Generation: Adaptive descriptions based on game phase
- Multi-language Support: Automatic language detection and response generation

Architecture:
- Prompt Engineering: Static prefixes with dynamic context injection
- Chain of Thought: Structured reasoning for identity inference
- Confidence Calibration: Systematic confidence adjustment based on evidence
- Logging: Debug logging for belief evolution tracking

_INFERENCE_PROMPT_PREFIX = """You are a player in the game "Who is the Spy". Your goal is to analyze the game state and update your beliefs.
- Pay close attention to whether other players' descriptions match your understanding of your word.
- If descriptions seem inconsistent with your word, you might be the Spy.
- IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in the same language as the user's word, which is: "{my_word}".

**Game Rules:**
- Players: {player_count}, Spies: {spy_count}
- Civilians get one word, the Spy gets a related one.
- Your word is: "{my_word}"
- You MUST respond in the same language as your word.

**Your Task:**
1.  First, complete the `<thinking>` block to structure your analysis.
2.  Then, based on your analysis, use the `PlayerMindset` tool to output your updated beliefs.

---
<thinking>
**1. Self-Role Analysis:**  
*   **Evidence FOR being SPY:**  
    *   **Group Consensus Conflict:** (Do multiple players' statements align with each other but conflict with your word "{my_word}"? List them.)    
    *   **Other Inconsistencies:** (List any other statements that feel odd or point to a different concept.)
*   **Evidence FOR being CIVILIAN:**  
    *   **Outlier Conflict:** (Did one player make a statement that conflicts with both your word AND other players' statements? Identify this outlier.)    
    *   **Strong Alignment:** (List statements from others that perfectly match your word( "{my_word}".)
    *   **Conclusion:** (Based on the evidence above, are you more likely the Spy or a Civilian? State your conclusion in one sentence.)  
**2. Suspicion Analysis (for each other alive player):**  
*   **Player [ID]:**  
    *   **Evidence:** (Analyze their speech. Is it consistent with the group? Is it an outlier? Is it vague?)    
    *   **Conclusion:** (Based on the evidence, are they likely a Spy or a Civilian?)
    *   **Player [ID]:**  
    *   ... (Repeat for all other alive players)
</thinking>
---

**Decision & Confidence Rules:**
- **Self-Role:**
    - Treat strong conflicts (two or more players matching each other while clashing with your word) as a **major clue** that you might be the Spy.
    - If the evidence is mixed, stay uncertain and keep probing; do **not** force a Spy conclusion if the group could still share your concept.
- **Self-Confidence:**
    - If you are convinced you are the **Spy**, set confidence to **0.8** (very certain but still cautious).
    - If you lean Civilian and have a clear suspect, set confidence to **0.75**.
    - If the evidence is ambiguous, keep confidence around **0.5–0.65** to reflect doubt.
- **Suspicions:**
    - Strong outliers (conflicting with both you and the group) are prime Spy candidates. Mark them as **Spy** with confidence **0.85**.
    - Very vague speakers earn light suspicion. Mark them as **Spy** around **0.55**.
    - Players aligned with the consensus should be tagged **Civilian** with confidence **0.75**.

**Final Instruction:**
Now, use the `PlayerMindset` tool to return the updated state based on your completed analysis. Do not provide any other text outside the tool output.
