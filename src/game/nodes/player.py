"""
Player node implementations for the "Who Is Spy" game.

This module contains the LangGraph nodes that handle player actions:
- Speech generation with strategic reasoning
- Voting decisions based on accumulated evidence
- Private state management and mindset updates

Each node represents a player's turn in the game flow and integrates
with the LLM strategy system to provide intelligent agent behavior.

Node Functions:
- player_speech: Generates speech using LLM reasoning and updates mindset
- player_vote: Makes voting decisions based on accumulated suspicions
- Helper functions: Context retrieval and private state management

Integration Points:
- Uses LLM strategy module for intelligent reasoning
- Integrates with state management for proper state updates
- Follows LangGraph node patterns for workflow integration
