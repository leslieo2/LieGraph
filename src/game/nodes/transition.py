    Vote convergence and state transition node.

    This node appears to 'do nothing' but has important architectural significance:

    1. **Convergence Point**: All player vote nodes (player_vote_[pid]) flow to this node
    2. **Waiting Mechanism**: When votes_ready(state) == False, LangGraph re-executes this node,
       implementing polling wait until all votes are collected
    3. **Conditional Routing Trigger**: Check votes_ready(state) via conditional edges to decide whether to enter host_result

    Analogy for understanding:
    - Each player puts their vote in the ballot box (player_vote)
    - Administrator periodically checks the box (check_votes_and_transition)
    - Votes not complete: Continue waiting (recheck)
    - Votes complete: Open box and count votes (host_result)

    Return value: Empty dict, because state transition logic is handled by conditional edges
