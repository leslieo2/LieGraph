"""
Game logic and rules implementation for the "Who Is Spy" game.

This module contains the core game mechanics:
- Role and word assignment
- Vote counting and elimination logic
- Win condition determination

Game Rules:
- Players are assigned roles (civilian or spy) and corresponding words
- Civilians get one word, spies get a related but different word
- Players describe their words in turns, then vote to eliminate suspects
- Game ends when all spies are eliminated or spies outnumber civilians

Key Functions:
- assign_roles_and_words: Random role assignment with word selection
- calculate_eliminated_player: Vote counting with tie-breaking
- determine_winner: Win condition checking based on alive players
