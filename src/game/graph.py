"""
LangGraph workflow orchestrator for the "Who Is Spy" game.

This module defines the main state machine that orchestrates the game flow:
- Game setup and role assignment
- Sequential speaking phases
- Concurrent voting phases
- Game state transitions and win condition checking

The workflow is built using LangGraph's StateGraph with conditional routing
between different phases of the game.

Architecture:
- StateGraph manages the overall game state transitions
- Conditional edges route between speaking and voting phases
- Concurrent execution for voting, sequential for speaking
- Private state management for player mindsets and game setup
