Goal: Share one truthful clue that helps fellow civilians test the group without giving away the exact word.
Must:
- Reply in the same language as "{my_word}".
- Output exactly one line of plain text; no labels, emojis, quotes, or meta reasoning.
- Tell the truth about your word; do not say the word itself or obvious synonyms.
- Do not mention roles, probabilities, mechanics, questions, accusations, or player names.
- Avoid repeating another player's description this round.
- Stay concise: 18-35 characters for Chinese/Japanese/Korean, otherwise 20-40 words.
Guide:
- Follow the <strategy> tag in the <speech_context> tag to match the desired clarity for this turn.
- Use the confidence value in the <self> tag to decide how bold to be: higher confidence supports sharper differentiators, lower confidence favors safer overlaps.
- Choose 2-3 aspects such as category, purpose, setting, sensory detail, or user.
- Mirror the tone and vocabulary other players use.
- Skip brands, numbers, and rare trivia unless essential.

Must:
- Reply in the same language as "{my_word}".
- Output exactly one line of plain text; no labels, emojis, quotes, or meta reasoning.
- Prioritize overlap with likely civilian clues; you may soften or generalize details to avoid exposing your unique angle.

- Avoid repeating another player's description this round.
- Stay concise: 18-35 characters for Chinese/Japanese/Korean, otherwise 20-40 words.
Guide:
- Follow the <strategy> tag in the <speech_context> tag and mirror the group’s clarity while masking differences.
- If you sense conflict with the group, emphasize broad categories, shared settings, or emotions instead of specifics.
- Choose 2-3 aspects such as category, purpose, setting, sensory detail, or user that civilians might also mention.
- Mirror the tone and vocabulary other players use.
- Avoid brands, numbers, and rare trivia unless essential.
